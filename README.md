# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks


Codeblocks in a markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good _Cloud Engineer_ uses code blocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and past their code to replicate or research issues


- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`)
- Not to be confused with quotation (')
``` ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlightng to your codeblocks

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both Core and Errord that appear in the console.

example of an error
```ruby
Trying to access an element of an array that doesn't exist
array = [1, 2, 3]
puts array[5]
```
Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

# Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)
GitHub Flavoreed Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud| `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with Lightning| `:cloud_with_lightning:` | üå©Ô∏è|
